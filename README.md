## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```
node >=8.0.0 && <11.0.0
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

```
npm install
```

And

```
npm start
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running in Docker

```
docker-compose up --build
```

## Explanation
Schema supports 2 user roles `merchant` and `customer`. `merchant` can create products which will be associated with an inventory and a store. The `customer` can only purchase items by adding it to his / her cart this will also decrement the inventory_count of a particular item.

### Security
![](/images/secure.png?raw=true)
I created post endpoints `/api/login` and `/api/signup` to login and create a new user respespectively. when a user is logs in a jwt token is generated and sent to the client with a 1 hour ttl. Without a valid jwt token you wont be a make queries or mutations to graphql.

Made a token just for you below ðŸ™‚. Test it out by adding it to the authorization header

```
token
```

## Deployment
Once travis-ci detects a change to the master branch a new build occurs which runs my unit, component and integration tests then the graphql application will be deployed to google's flexible app engine. which is built directly from the Dockerfile
